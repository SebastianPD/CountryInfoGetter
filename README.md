# AndroidAppDemo

<strong> Description </strong></p>
An app I made as a technical challenge for a company. It has my resume, and then you can select a list of countries which will pull information of that country from a website link.

For getting information from the website, I made an AsyncTask that would get the country selected as an input string. The string would then be attached to a URL I would then retrieve. Finally, I would then parse the string and only extract the information I thought was necessary like population and capital of the country.

<strong> What I learned </strong> 
* AsyncTasks
* InputStreams
* OutPutStreams
* URL Connections
* Activity Stack
